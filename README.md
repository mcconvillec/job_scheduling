# job_scheduling

This repository provides a simplifed/sanitzed version of a constraint programming model developed to help optimise the scheduling of customer product migrations for a major company, overall enabling them to more proactively manage their product lifecycle.

A key reason constraint programming was chosen for this problem rather than MILP or other forms of integer programming was the fewer number of constraints/decision-variables that needed to be included in the model given the lack of a linearity requirement.
